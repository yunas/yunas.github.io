				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to diversity in general, change happens slowly – and new racially diverse emoji are no different. Emojis emigrated from<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/4/3966140/how-emoji-conquered-the-world" target="_blank"> their native Japan</a> to the rest of the world via iOS 5 in late 2011 and were quickly received to wide popular acclaim. Their popularity has only increased since then, as reflected by Apple&#8217;s decision to <a href="http://blog.getemoji.com/post/87783145325/ios-8-emoji-keyboard-is-enabled-by-default-no" target="_blank">enable emojis</a> by default in iOS 8. So everyone was excited when, in March 2014, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/25/diverse-apple-emojis/" target="_blank">Apple pledged</a> to create racially diverse emoji. Seems like a relatively easy way to promote racial harmony in our digital lives, right? Wrong! <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/02/23/apple-emoji-racially-diverse/" target="_blank">These just-announced</a> racially diverse emoji won&#8217;t be coming anytime soon to many of the phones near you.</p>
<p>To understand why, you need to know a thing or two about the technical infrastructure supporting emoji. Computers transmit data in a different form than their end users see it. A set of standards called Unicode governs how data about characters gets used across compliant operating systems, and how that data is rendered visually.  Unicode <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/tr51-1.html#Emoji_Modifiers" target="_blank">rolled out standards</a> regarding racially diverse emoji, called the &#8220;skin tone modifier,&#8221; and now Apple is poised to be the first operating system to implement them. But it remains unclear as to when Google will begin supporting the skin tone modifier in Android.</p>
<p>Notice that already <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/emoji-meaning_n_5530638.html" target="_blank">emoji look different </a>on Android and iOS machines, because there is some flexibility in how the basic emoji can be drawn. The emoji will continue to look different as Android users migrate to versions of their operating system that support the Unicode skin tone modifier. But there&#8217;s no skin tone modifier-inclusive Android version on the horizon yet, and Android updates are notoriously slow at trickling down to users anyways. Currently, as reported in <em>Business Insider</em>, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/android-lollipop-adoption-is-abysmal-2015-1" target="_blank">almost nobody</a> is using the latest version of Android. So even if Google supported the skin tone modifier beginning in an Android release available tomorrow, it would be years before most Android phones could show that progressive, diverse array of smiling multiracial human faces.</p>
<p>Although Apple&#8217;s PR team specifically explained that &#8220;these racially diverse emoji can only be guaranteed to appear on iOS 8.3&#8243; (rumored to become available in March), don&#8217;t expect real-life users to grasp this. Instead, just wait for the internet outrage machine to spin into furious action when Apple users text brown- or black-skinned emoji people to their Android-using friends, and the images fail to load! That little blank box that shows up on your phone when a character fails to render couldn&#8217;t possibly be any less culturally sensitive or politically incorrect. The bloggy screeds about new technologies, once again, erasing &#8220;people of color&#8221; will never end. Google will be accused of cultural colonialism not only <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-25/google-buses-fuel-inequality-debate-as-boom-inflates-rents-tech" target="_blank">in the Bay area</a> but now <em>in their own customer&#8217;s pockets</em>.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t say we didn&#8217;t warn you. At least the all-white emoji are an <em>obviously</em> limited one-size-all representation of human bodies. Now, no good Unicode deed is going to go unpunished, and new racially diverse emoji will create more controversy than they&#8217;ll solve.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here at Fueled, a design and development company based in New York and London, we are obsessed with everything that happens in mobile, be it rumors of iPhone hardware, delectable Android updates or new apps we love. Every Friday, we’d like to help you top up your weekly knowledge of the mobile industry so you can keep your finger on the pulse.</p>
<h2>Android in Decline</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16746" alt="androidchart2" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/androidchart2.png" width="650" height="314" /></p>
<p>Android shipped over a billion smartphones last year, something Apple won&#8217;t be able to replicate for years but we learned this week that Android sales went into decline in Q4 2014 for the first time&#8230; ever. The beginning of a trend? <em>via <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/android-sales-in-decline-for-first-time-ever-2015-2">Business Insider</a></em></p>
<h2>iOS 9</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16743" alt="screenshot-2015-02-09-10-23-35" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/screenshot-2015-02-09-10-23-35.png" width="704" height="350" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s rumored that Apple&#8217;s iOS 9 won&#8217;t bring the new feature updates users are used to. According to 9to5 Mac, iOS 9 will focus on fixing bugs, maintaining stability, and boosting phone performance. <em>via <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/02/09/apples-ios-9-to-have-huge-stability-and-optimization-focus-after-years-of-feature-additions/">9to5Mac</a></em></p>
<h2>Google Payments</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16747" alt="eric-schmidt-19" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/eric-schmidt-19.jpg" width="480" height="360" /></p>
<p>Google is working on a new payments service to compete with Apple Pay. The new system is internally called Plaso and will require users to say their initals to a cashier in order to make a purchase. Sounds&#8230; interesting. <em>via <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-plaso-an-awkward-payments-platform-2015-2">Business Insider</a></em></p>
<h2>Dayo</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16744" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-13 at 7.03.59 PM" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-13-at-7.03.59-PM.png" width="680" height="586" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to announce the launch of Dayo, an app we built that launched in the App Store this week. Dayo is a social network that allows you to create fun and beautiful visual stories to share with your freinds and family. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dayo-share-days/id961210800?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Check it out</a>.</p>
<h2>Trigraphy</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16745" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-13 at 7.08.27 PM" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-13-at-7.08.27-PM.png" width="1056" height="654" /></p>
<p>Fueled designer Chris Bannister turned us on to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trigraphy-create-low-poly-art/id950513582?mt=8">Trigraphy</a> this week. Turn your photos into works of art.</p>

<p>Samsung sent out invitations to its latest Unpacked Event. That means, expect the newest Samsung Galaxy to be introduced March first. <em>via <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/2/7967623/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-mwc-2015">Verge</a></em></p>
<h2>Microsoft Buys Sunrise</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16721" alt="sunrise-app" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/sunrise-app.png" width="1009" height="718" /></p>
<p>Microsoft bought the popular app Sunrise this week. This is the company&#8217;s second acquisition of a &#8220;hot&#8221; app in the last two months. Last month, Microsoft bought email app Acompli. <em>via <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-acquires-sunrise-calendar-app/">CNET</a></em></p>
<h2>Apple&#8217;s First Andriod App</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16720" alt="Screen Shot 2015-02-06 at 6.28.45 PM" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-06-at-6.28.45-PM.png" width="783" height="569" /></p>
<p>Apple is working on its first Andriod app. The streaming music service will reportedly look to compete with Spotify. The app is the product of Apple&#8217;s acquisition of Beats Music several months ago. <em>via <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-is-making-its-first-android-app-2015-2">Business Insider</a></em></p>
<h2>Madonna on Snapchat</h2>

<p>Madonna premiered her latest video, <em>Living for Love</em> , on Snapchat&#8217;s new featured channel Discover. We think this headline from <a href="http://jezebel.com/madonna-desperately-clings-to-the-youth-by-releasing-vi-1684112184">Jezebel</a> sums it up: &#8220;Madonna Desperately Clings to the Youth by Releasing Video on Snapchat&#8221; <em>via <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/5/7987465/madonna-snapchat-music-video">Verge</a></em></p>
<h2>Cool App: Detour</h2>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Let’s say that you have a brilliant idea for a new app, an app that you think could attract some serious venture capital cash. But right now it’s just an idea. No potential investor can try it out, and you can’t cite any real world successes to prove you’re not just some starry eyed dreamer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You need to build your app and get it out there into the world to prove itself. So you approach a respected app design firm — maybe <a href="http://fueled.com/?utm_source=Homepage&amp;utm_medium=audienceio&amp;utm_term=audienceio&amp;utm_campaign=Homepage">ours</a> — and you’re quoted a five-figure or six-figure price tag. The app we’ll build will be beautiful, responsive, intuitive, a pleasure to use… everything you’re dreaming of and more. But your app hasn’t yet earned you a dime, so how are you going to pay to have it made?</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is a really common conundrum for app startups, and it’s one that many billion-dollar-valuation apps struggled with in their early days. Fortunately, those who have gone before you have mapped out several paths to funding success.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Option 1: Self-Funding</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Are you independently wealthy? Then you should fund the initial app build yourself. If you don’t believe in your idea enough to fund it with your own riches, then you shouldn’t be asking someone else to take that risk.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Build Cheap</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Even if you can afford to spend a quarter of a million dollars building a fully featured and beautifully designed initial app, that doesn’t mean you should. Save (most) of your money and build a cheap prototype that has only the most essential functions you need to test and prove your big idea.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Find a freelance developer in Eastern Europe or Asia and pay them a few thousand dollars to do this. They don’t have to be the world’s best developer, only good enough to build a working prototype.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But don’t build a prototype expecting big success. Build it to learn what users like and don’t like about your idea, and to demonstrate to VC investors that your idea has traction. It’s OK if users tell you that it’s a cool idea, but it crashes every other time they use it. Or that they’d use it a lot more if you changed x, y, and z. That is very valuable information.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Feedback like this is gold, it shows engagement. It shows that users want to like your app, even if they don’t right now. There are only two kinds of bad feedback at this stage: feedback that says your app’s core idea is boring or stupid, or no feedback at all.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Engaged complaints, however, convey one thing to VC investors: potential.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Self-funding” need not be only for the 1%. Are you working a day job? Great, keep it, and save up some of your income to fund your prototype for a few thousand dollars. Again, if you believe in your app, you should be willing to risk your own money on it. If you’re not willing to take that risk, you probably shouldn’t ask someone else to do so.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But if you simply don’t have enough money to fully self-fund even your cheap prototype app, then read on&#8230;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16713" alt="HNCK0082-1300x866 copy" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/HNCK0082-1300x866-copy.jpg" width="1300" height="866" /></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Get a Co-Founder</h3>
<p dir="ltr">If you can partially but not completely self-fund, consider partnering with a co-founder who is willing to share the cost and risk with you. Bringing on a co-founder is a really good idea even if you don’t need the capital. Many VC firms won’t even consider investing in an idea unless there are at least two founders. Having a co-founder means that you’ve convinced at least one other person that your idea is worth pursuing. Maybe you’re both crazy, but at least you will have to continually defend your ideas to one another and refine them accordingly.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Friends and Family</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Finally in self-funding, there’s the friends and family plan: asking your loved ones to kick in a few hundred dollars each to help you fund the prototype. It’s a risky way to go, so proceed with caution if at all. Be scrupulously candid and clear with your family and friends about the risks. That’s a good practice with any investor, but it’s especially important when you’re mixing business with family and friendship.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Option 2: Build It Yourself</h2>
<p dir="ltr">If you have or feel able to learn the technical skills to build the prototype yourself, this is your best option. Remember, you’re only building a functional first draft of your app, so you don’t have to be a seasoned veteran. Once your prototype wins you VC funding, you can bring in a firm like ours to build the beautiful final release.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Seriously, Get a Co-Founder</h3>
<p dir="ltr">If you’re not technically skilled yourself, consider bringing in a co-founder who is. Just as VC firms prefer startups with co-founders, they also prefer startups with at least one technically skilled founder. That founder doesn’t need to be an uber-ninja coder, though obviously it’s very valuable. They only need to be good enough to build your crappy prototype. Investors will like knowing that at least one person at the helm has knowledge of technical matters, even if you later outsource the final <a title="Mobile App Development " href="http://fueled.com/mobile-app-development/">app development</a>.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Tweak It While You Seek It</h3>
<p dir="ltr">There’s another benefit to having someone in-house with technical skills. There’s a very good chance that you won’t build just one prototype. Your initial prototype might not get any traction with users, so you’ll have no case for VC funding. You’ll spend some time figuring out why people don’t like your app, deciding what you want to tweak, and then you’ll want to build another prototype. Maybe that one will do better, maybe it won’t. Maybe you’ll make a third prototype. If you’re hiring that guy in Eastern Europe, you’re writing more checks each time. But if it’s you or your co-founder making the prototypes, you can tweak as much as your available time will allow.</p>
<p dir="ltr">How many prototypes? As many as it takes to earn traction with users and make a case to VC firms. Or until you decide the idea just wasn’t that good after all. Then you write off the time and hopefully modest money you spent, and you get to work on a better idea.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16715" alt="shutterstock_180056618" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shutterstock_180056618.jpg" width="1000" height="667" /></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Ideas That Won’t Get Funding</h3>
<p dir="ltr">All of this assumes that your idea is indeed one that could potentially be funded. There’s no magic equation to determine whether you’re wasting your time and money or if a VC will actually invest. You may toil away in obscurity for two or three years like Ben Silbermann did before <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> became an “overnight” success. Only you can decide whether you still believe in the idea enough to keep trying.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That said, before you spend your money and give up all your free time, it’s worth considering how VC firms will evaluate your app. You don’t need to provide guarantees that your app is going to become a billion dollar idea, and, actually, if you try, you’ll likely get written off as not having an appreciation of risk. But you do need to show that there’s at least the possibility of your app vastly scaling up into something big. VC firms bet on bunches of ideas like this, knowing that most won’t pan out, but they don’t bet on ideas that have no chance of going big.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Is your app idea is a casual game that, if it’s really successful, might get 10,000 downloads a month at 99 cents gross revenue a pop? That’s great. If it succeeds, it can be a nice source of some extra income for you on the side. But you’re not ever going to hire your own development team on that revenue stream. You’re either going to build and maintain it yourself, or you’re going to partner with a developer who likes the idea and agrees to do the development work for a share of the profits. And VC firms aren’t going to fund you. That’s fine, just make sure you understand that going in.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Once Your Prototype Gets Traction</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Congratulations! Your app is actually scalable and potentially something VC firms might fund. The prototype &#8212; whether it’s the first prototype or the seventeenth &#8212; is getting some real traction. Users are complaining about bugs and demanding missing features, but they’re using your app! They’re engaged!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now what?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Don’t break ground on your new corporate headquarters yet. Your successful prototype is a big step toward funding, but you still have to convince investors to take a chance on you. Paul Graham has written what I consider the <a href="http://paulgraham.com/convince.html">definitive guide</a> to convincing investors to fund you, so, rather than try to restate it, I’ll just send you to the source. Read what he has to say now, even before you build your prototype. It will help guide you along the way. Then, once you have a successful prototype, read it again.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the beginning of a new idea, when you have nothing, this all can seem very daunting. I won’t tell you it’s not hard. It is. And you may labor at this for a long time before you have any real idea whether you’re going to succeed. That’s both the thrill and the burden of entrepreneurship. Where it will take you, I can’t say. But it’s definitely going to be a wild ride.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every week at Fueled, the premier app <a href="http://fueled.com/iphone-app-design/">design agency</a>, our London-based lead designer Rob Palmer shares a handful of inspirational websites with our teams in New York and Chicago. This weekly email acts like a virtual water cooler, encouraging us to congregate across time zones and discuss what brands and blogs are doing to push new trends in web design.</p>
<h2>Rally Interactive</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16698" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-30 at 11.54.01 AM" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-30-at-11.54.01-AM.png" width="1079" height="704" /></p>
<p>We admire Rally Interactive, an agency based in Salt Lake City. Rally&#8217;s beta site is minimal, clean, and easy to navigate, which is great, but we recommend spending some time looking through the company&#8217;s featured projects. Our favorite? Without a doubt the National Parks <a href="http://beta.rallyinteractive.com/national-parks/">case study.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://beta.rallyinteractive.com/">Rally Interactive</a></p>
<h2>Trippeo</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16699" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-30 at 11.56.25 AM" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-30-at-11.56.25-AM.png" width="1250" height="663" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to make an expense management tool seem sexy, but Trippeo nails it. Using animations and clever strolling, you get a comprehensive yet easy to understand overview of the platform. What more could you ask for?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.trippeo.com/">Trippeo</a></p>
<h2>Ideas by Music</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16700" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-30 at 11.57.27 AM" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-30-at-11.57.27-AM.png" width="1143" height="663" /></p>
<p>Ideas by Music is a creative agency based in Manchester. In ten points, that emerge through scrolling, the website seeks to convince you that they&#8217;re the creative agency for your brand. Utilizing great fullscreen video and images, it&#8217;s a busy a site, without being overwhelming.</p>
<p><a href="http://ideasbymusic.com/">Ideas by Music</a></p>
<h2>Tim Brack</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16701" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-30 at 11.58.20 AM" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-30-at-11.58.20-AM.png" width="1232" height="664" /></p>
<p>We always like to check out what other designers and developers are doing with their own personal portfolio sites. Tim Brack&#8217;s  is straightforward but showcases his eye for moment, both in the site&#8217;s unusual navigation and in the presentation of his work.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.timbrack.de/">Tim Brack </a></p>
<h2>It&#8217;s Just Yes</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16702" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-30 at 12.02.34 PM" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-30-at-12.02.34-PM.png" width="1171" height="690" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s Just Yes is &#8220;a store for people who want to buy less, but better.&#8221; The shop features a smattering of items from house plants to kettles, but each is photographed and presented in a way that, in a millisecond, makes you want to buy it. The site is clean, simple, uncluttered. It&#8217;s this simplicity that makes it so convincing.</p>

<h2>Echoes of the Tsunami</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.echoesoftsunami.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16666" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-15 at 18.10.22" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-15-at-18.10.22.png" width="1399" height="697" /></a></p>
<p>Last month marked ten years since the 2004 Tsunami devastated South East Asia: one moment in time that would cause enough devastation to last a lifetime. International humanitarian organization Action Contre la Faim (Action Against Hunger) commemorates the anniversary by letting us relive the memories of those who suffered most: this stunning website takes us back in time, by way of beautiful photography and film, to the four Indonesian cities that felt the wave the hardest.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.echoesoftsunami.com/" target="_blank">Echoes of the Tsunami</a></p>
<h2>Haruki Murakami</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.harukimurakami.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16665" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-15 at 18.09.02" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-15-at-18.09.02.png" width="1414" height="742" /></a></p>
<p>Internationally renowned author Haruki Murakami is a favorite storyteller to many. His author website is a virtual destination for his fans to peer into his world, even after they’ve turned the last page of his books. Learn about the man behind the words, take a virtual tour of his desk, browse through a gallery of his daily inspirations or discover testimonials from a community of Murakami-lovers: all of this is displayed across an impeccable layout that incorporates Japanese-style contemporary lines and minimalist animations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.harukimurakami.com/" target="_blank">Haruki Murakami</a></p>
<h2>Jackaroo Caravans</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://jackaroocaravans.com/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-15 at 18.04.56" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-15-at-18.04.56.png" width="1414" height="743" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Leave it to the Aussies to be the best at creating custom ‘vintage retro caravans’ &#8212; and designing a website that makes us actually want to buy one. Jackaroo Caravans presents a website that rings true to their motto: “vintage era meeting meets modern age”. It lets you parallax scroll through appropriately sepia-filtered images that elegantly hide pockets of information and a layout that cleverly mimics the design and colors of their product.</p>
<p><a href="http://jackaroocaravans.com/" target="_blank">Jackaroo Caravans</a></p>
<h2>Zenvala</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://zenvala.com"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16663" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-15 at 18.03.45" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-15-at-18.03.45.png" width="1394" height="742" /></a></p>
<p>There are <em>a lot</em> of young e-commerce boutiques out there like Zenvala, but not many that manage to make their branding and UX design work like theirs. The site’s landing page greets us with a single fixed background photograph as the focal point, complimented by a sunkissed color scheme and a subtle animation that gives the page depth. (We’re fans of the logo, fixed header and newsletter banner that pops up as a footer, too.) The page naturally prompts us to click towards the site’s shop, where a tight grid of photographs display beachy products with a cool-blue scroll over effect. Let’s go surfing, already.</p>
<p><a href="http://zenvala.com/" target="_blank">Zenvala</a></p>
<h2>Hum Creative</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://humcreative.com"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-15 at 18.02.31" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-15-at-18.02.31.png" width="1408" height="743" /></a></p>
<p>There’s a ton of ultra cool stuff going on in this Seattle-based design agency’s website, but the coolest is the display their ‘header’ navigation across four corners of the homepage. This magazine-like site is fresh, fun, contemporary and stays interesting with every click.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That groundbreaking idea for an app has finally come to you – now you just have to refine and mold it into a well-rounded app concept. But, before you can throw things into full swing, there are some steps that need to be taken to ensure your app’s success.</p>
<h3>Find the Right Developers and Designers</h3>
<p>If you can&#8217;t develop an app yourself, then seek out a proper team of developers to build your product. Dig deep and do your research so you can find the  developers and designers that fit your needs. Using someone who doesn&#8217;t understand you, or your vision, can be dangerous.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16650" alt="IMG_7446-1300x866" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_7446-1300x866.jpg" width="1300" height="866" /></p>
<h3>Generating Buzz</h3>
<p>After finding the right developer and designer, the next step is getting people to learn about your future app. To do this you need to create buzz.</p>
<p>Here are a couple ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write up a tech blog for your app and fill it with previews of the elegant features your app possesses. Include videos, photos, and any relevant information. Apply demos to the site so users can get a taste of what it will feel like to use the product in the future. Be sure to link the app store so your users can find and download your app. When creating content for your site, remember to utilize keywords as much as you can to make your site search engine optimized (SEO). SEO can boost your rankings in Google search making users more likely to stumble upon your site, and your app.</li>
<li>Do your research – have your app come out when the highest amount of readers are online. How do competitors market themselves and what is their revenue model? Launching app giveaways, running contests and previewing demos are just a few ways to intrigue the blogosphere.</li>
<li>Get people to test your app in order to create interest. Good user experience will lead to one of the best forms of marketing: positive word of mouth. The more people hear from others that the app is worth your download, the more likely it is they will give it a try themselves.</li>
<li>Before you release your app, be sure to craft a press release announcing it to interested media outlets such as tech blogs, and app review sites. Apple, for example, takes a look at positive press coverage when deciding which apps to display in featured app sections in the App Store.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without buzz, your app could get lost in the millions of apps within the app store (it’s scary how many there are). Marketing your app is just as important as the idea and development.</p>
<h2>Branding and Logo</h2>
<p>To understand why a logo is important think about this: every good superhero has a recognizable emblem, and the world’s biggest brands are recognizable immediately by their symbol. Spider Man without his suit is just a weirdo doing parkour.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16649" alt="beemark_512x512-1198b82cbb0985850a045a62467dbfb2" src="http://fueled.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/beemark_512x512-1198b82cbb0985850a045a62467dbfb2.png" width="512" height="512" /></p>
<p>Not only is the app’s logo the face of your new product, but it is how your app is recognized and how it will be remembered. An exceptional trademark makes your app stand out in the competitive market and offers an eye-catching edge.</p>
<p>When you create your logo make sure you have higher quality resolution photos for press and marketing purposes, or it will look cheap and lazy.</p>
<h2>Video Previews &#8211; Anticipation is Key!</h2>
<p>Take your clients through a visual online experience before they get the actual in app experience. Use different screen capturing softwares to walk your clients through the apps features. Upload the cinematic experience to YouTube with the proper editing and you’ve got yourself a prime outlet for gaining an early audience.</p>
<h2>A Slammin’ Pitch</h2>
<p>You should formulate pitches for different purposes with flexible lengths. Pitches should range from a few concise sentences for featured sections that touch on the main selling points to longer pitches for press releases that are rich and interesting.</p>
<p>People love to find the latest and greatest tools out on the market, so giving your app early exposure is always a great direction to start.</p>
<p>The ranking algorithm, unique to the app store, dictates the necessity to attract a large pool of downloads in as short a time as possible in order to rank higher. This algorithm shows just how important it is to get the ball rolling early on. So stay ahead of your competitors by getting things started before your app launched so you can hit the ground running.</p>
